# 213. House Robber II<sup style="color: rgb(255, 192, 30);">Medium</sup>

> You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each
  house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are
  **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the
  last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and
  **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken
  into on the same night.**
>
> Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house,
  return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the
  police.**_
